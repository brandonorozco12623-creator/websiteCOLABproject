## Application to Our Business Category

### Why This Archetype Fits

The Sage archetype is ideal for AI training and consulting because the industry is characterized by complexity and widespread confusion. Businesses recognize AI's importance but struggle with implementation—creating a perfect scenario for the Sage to cut through noise and provide clarity.

AI consulting requires deep expertise and the ability to translate complex technical concepts into actionable strategies. The Sage positions us as trusted advisors rather than vendors, emphasizing education and empowerment over dependency. This builds long-term relationships based on trust and results.

Our target audience—executives at established companies—specifically seeks expert guidance. The Sage's focus on methodology, proven processes, and evidence-based approaches resonates more than aggressive sales tactics. It differentiates us from competitors while offering sustainable value: wisdom, understanding, and partnership.
